# Data-Structures
I will be using this repository to learn and implement whatever is taught to me by Professor Debayan for his course Data Structures.


# learning how to commit to github
- git status
- git add .
- git commit -m "message" -m "this will add description"
- git push origin master

- Made ssh key and added it to github

# Branching
- git branch
- git checkout -b branch_name (to create a new branch and checkout to it)
- git checkout branch_name (to checkout to an existing branch)
- git diff branch_name (to see the difference between the two branches)
- if i make changes in a branch and then checkout to master, the changes will not be reflected in master (unless i merge the branches)
- git branch -d branch_name (to delete a branch)

# resetting
- git reset HEAD~# (to reset to the last commit) (# is the number of commits you want to go back)
